Debug iOS Touch Handling
=====================

Debugging touch events can be a pain in the butt. Whether you're adding a multiple target-action pairs in `cellForRowAtIndexPath` or somewhere in the hierarchy, a view isn't large enough to contain its subviews, the debugging process can be opaque. 

This category on `UIView` helps to solve that by printing helpful debug information.
